Metagenome-assembled genomes detected during the weeklong period following rewetting and associated data are found in this folder. This includes:
1. mag_rel_abun_filtered_prophage.csv
* Contains relative abundances per replicate per time point per MAG and its taxonomic ID used in analyses
2. qSIP_MAG_100p.csv
* Output of quantitative Stable Isotope Probing (qSIP) formulas used to calculate atom fraction excess (AFE) from 18O-H2O applied during rewetting. See https://github.com/bramstone/qsip for qSIP calculations
